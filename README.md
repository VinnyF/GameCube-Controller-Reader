# GameCube Controller Reader
Use GameCube controllers with your Arduino projects!

With the right wiring, this library will read the state of a connected GameCube controller into an object
that can be accessed in its individual parts. The current state of buttons and the position of the analog 
inputs are all available. Use these values to control anything with your Arduino.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/VinnyF/GameCube-Controller-Reader/wiki) for full documentation.
